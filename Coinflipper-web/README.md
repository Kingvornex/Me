## ðŸŽ® Fixed Issues & Enhancements:

### **âœ… Fixed Coin Positioning After Flip:**
- **Problem**: Coins were going off-screen after flipping because positioning didn't account for coin size properly
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper boundary checking with `Math.max(0, ...)` to ensure coordinates never go negative
  - Used exact pixel dimensions (48px for coins, 32px for minions) instead of arbitrary values
  - Added `updateTableSize()` call before positioning to ensure current table dimensions
  - Implemented safe positioning logic: `maxX = tableWidth - coinSize` and `maxY = tableHeight - coinSize`
  - Applied the same fix to initial coin placement, coin flips, and minion positioning

### **âœ… Added Descriptions to Shop Items:**
- **Enhanced Shop UI**: Restructured shop items to include detailed descriptions
- **Coin Descriptions**:
  - **Bronze Coin**: "Basic coin that pays $1 when flipped successfully. Great for starting your coin empire!"
  - **Silver Coin**: "Premium coin that pays $5 when flipped successfully. 5x more valuable than bronze coins!"
  - **Gold Coin**: "Luxury coin that pays $25 when flipped successfully. The ultimate money-making machine!"

- **Minion Descriptions**:
  - **Basic Minion**: "Entry-level minion that automatically flips coins for you. Works at moderate speed."
  - **Advanced Minion**: "Upgraded minion that flips coins twice as fast as basic minions. Great for scaling your empire!"
  - **Master Minion**: "Elite minion that flips coins at lightning speed. The pinnacle of automated coin flipping!"
